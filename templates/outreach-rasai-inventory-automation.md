## Cold Email

**Subject:** Inventory sync across {location_count} locations — how are you handling it?

**Alt subjects:**
- Quick question about {brand_name}'s inventory workflow
- {contact_name} — automating reorders across {location_count} locations

**Body:**

Hey {contact_name},

I noticed {brand_name} runs {location_count} locations and sells on {marketplaces} — so I'm guessing you know the pain of keeping inventory, costs, and reorder decisions in sync across all of it.

We recently built an automation system for a multi-location retailer in a similar setup. They were spending 6+ hours a week pulling reports, cross-referencing supplier catalogs, and manually syncing Amazon product costs with their actual POS costs. Now it's zero. The system generates purchase orders from real sales data, syncs pricing automatically, and plans FBA shipments — all without spreadsheets.

I'm not selling a generic SaaS — we build these integrations specifically for multi-channel retailers. If your team is spending 3+ hours a week on inventory tasks, it's probably worth a 15-minute call to see if the math makes sense for you.

Open to a quick chat this week?

## LinkedIn Connection Request

(~300 char limit)

Hi {contact_name} — I work with multi-location retailers who sell on {marketplaces}. We automate inventory sync, purchase orders, and cost management between POS and marketplace systems. Built a system that cut one client's manual inventory work from 6 hrs/week to zero. Would love to connect.

## LinkedIn Follow-Up

(Send after they accept the connection)

Thanks for connecting, {contact_name}.

Quick question — how's your team currently handling reorder decisions across your {location_count} locations? Specifically, keeping what's on your shelves in sync with what {marketplaces} says you need to restock.

We built an automation layer for a retailer in a similar setup (multi-location POS + Amazon FBA, 500+ SKUs). It pulls actual sales history and generates purchase orders automatically — no more spreadsheets or guesswork. Also keeps product costs in sync across systems so margins don't drift.

If that sounds relevant, happy to walk you through what we built in 15 minutes. No pitch deck — just the actual system.

## Personalization Tips

1. **Check their website** ({website}) before sending — mention a specific product or category they sell
2. **Reference their tech stack** — if they use Shopify + Amazon, mention that specific combo
3. **Mention their city** — "I saw you have locations in {cities}" adds local credibility
4. **Use their title** — if {contact_title} is "Operations Manager", lean into the time-savings angle; if "Owner/CEO", lean into the ROI angle
5. **One channel per lead** — don't email AND LinkedIn the same person simultaneously
6. **Follow up once** after 3-5 business days if no response, then move on

## Follow-Up Email

**Body:**

Hey {contact_name},

Just bumping this in case it got buried. Happy to share a quick breakdown of what we built for a similar multi-location retailer — no commitment, just context.

If timing's off, no worries at all.
